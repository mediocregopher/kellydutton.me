                        <p>While my educational background is largely rooted in the liberal arts and social sciences, my master’s education and three years of editing experience have afforded me with the mastery of English used in the academic sphere, including in journal article submissions, conference presentations, master’s theses, and Ph.D. theses.

                        <p>
                          After graduating from the University of Florida with a
                          triple major, I conducted marketing and management
                          activities for a nationwide residential property
                          management company. I then returned to graduate school
                          and completed my master's degree in Political
                          Science with a specialization in Security and
                          Diplomacy. Since then, I have worked as a freelance
                          marketing strategist/copywriter for both individuals
                          and businesses worldwide.
